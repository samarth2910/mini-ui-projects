# 💡 FB Feature Clone — Mini UI Projects

A set of small frontend UI interactions recreated using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**.  
This mini-project collection is focused on cloning popular social media UI behaviors as part of my frontend learning journey.

## ✅ Completed Projects

### 🔹 1. Friend Request Button (Facebook Style)

A simple toggle interaction inspired by Facebook's "Add Friend" feature:

- Click to toggle between **"Add Friend" ↔ "Friends"**
- Button text and color change dynamically
- Built using JavaScript DOM manipulation and basic event handling

---

### 🔹 2. Double Tap Like (Instagram Style)

Mimics Instagram’s double-tap post-like animation:

- Clicking the image triggers a heart animation overlay  
- Uses CSS keyframes + JavaScript for interaction  
- Great for practicing timed visual feedback and custom animations

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **HTML5**  
- **CSS3** (Flexbox, Keyframes, Transitions)  
- **Vanilla JavaScript** (DOM manipulation, event handling)

---

## 🎯 Why I Built These

- To replicate real-world UI patterns from apps like Facebook and Instagram  
- Practice JS logic, CSS animation, and user interaction  
- Build confidence before diving into React
